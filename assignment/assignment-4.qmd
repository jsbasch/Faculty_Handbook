## Description

Movies, TV shows, books, and even TikToks often portray how people grow and change. But how accurate are these portrayals based on what you’re learning about developmental psychology? In this assignment, you’ll **analyze development in the media** to connect class concepts to real-world (or fictional) examples.

**Points:** {{< var assign_points >}}

#### **Instructions**

-   **Choose Your Media Example:**

    -   Select **one** of the following:

        -   A **movie or TV show** that depicts a character’s development (e.g., Inside Out, Boyhood, Stranger Things, Big Mouth).

        -   A **children’s book** that shows developmental milestones.

        -   A **YouTube or TikTok video** focused on parenting, adolescence, or developmental changes.

        -   Another approved media example relevant to lifespan development (send me a quick email if this is what you choose).

-   **Watch or Review It Carefully:**

    -   Take notes on **how it depicts a developmental stage, milestone, or issue.**

-   **Write a Reflection (300–400 words):**

    -   **Describe the media example** you chose (title, creator, brief summary). Include a link if possible.

    -   Identify **at least two developmental psychology concepts or theories** you see in it (e.g., Piaget’s stages, Erikson’s psychosocial stages, attachment styles, parenting styles, adolescence identity development).

    -   **Explain each concept clearly** and discuss how it shows up in the media example.

    -   **Critique it:** Is the portrayal accurate or stereotyped? Why?

    -   Share **any personal insights or questions** it raised about development.

#### **Friendly Reminders**

-   **Choose something that interests you** – your favorite show, a nostalgic children’s book, or a trending video.

-   **Be specific.** Don’t just name a concept – explain it in your own words and analyze how it’s shown.

-   **Keep it respectful.** Avoid sharing critiques in a way that insults creators or characters; focus on psychological analysis.
