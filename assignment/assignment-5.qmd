## Description

Personality psychology explores what makes each of us unique (or similar). In this assignment, you’ll **“test drive” personality assessments**, evaluate them critically, and connect your results to theories learned in class.

Not all personality assessments are created equally. Some are built upon decades of research while others are less consistent and valid. You will compare 2 types of tests to one another.

**Points:** {{< var assign_points >}}

#### **Instructions**

**Complete Two Assessments:**

-    **First Assessment (Research background):**

    -   Take a **Big Five Personality Test** (e.g., Open Psychometrics Big Five).

-   **Second Assessment (Less Validated):**

    -   Choose a less scientifically supported test such as:

        -   **Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)** (free version online)

        -   **Enneagram Test** (free version online)

        -   Another instructor-approved personality test lacking strong empirical support (send me an email with one you would like to use)

**Record Your Results:**

-   Note your Big Five scores (e.g., high in openness, low in neuroticism).

-   Note your MBTI type, Enneagram number, or equivalent classification.

**Write a Reflection (350–450 words):**

-   **Describe both assessments** (what they measure, how they classify people).

-   **Summarize your results** from each.

-   **Compare and contrast** the two assessments:

    -   How do their approaches differ?

    -   Which felt more accurate to you, and why?

    -   What are **strengths and weaknesses** of each based on course concepts and readings?

    -   Reflect on **what this comparison teaches you about personality psychology and assessment validity.**

### **Rubric (35 points total)**

| Criteria | Points | Description |
|----|----|----|
| **Assessment Descriptions & Results** | 10 | Clearly describes both assessments, including what each measures, how it classifies people, and accurately summarizes personal results for both tests. Demonstrates understanding of assessment content and outcomes. |
| **Comparison & Analysis** | 10 | Thoughtfully compares and contrasts the two assessments, addressing differences in approach, classification, scientific validity, and personal accuracy. Integrates course concepts (e.g., validity, reliability, trait theory) to support analysis. |
| **Connection to Personality Theory** | 5 | Identifies and explains at least one relevant personality theory from class (e.g., trait theory, humanistic approach) and connects it effectively to the critique or analysis of one or both assessments. |
| **Reflection & Personal Insight** | 5 | Provides meaningful and personal reflection on what was learned about personality assessment, self-perceptions, and scientific evaluation. Demonstrates critical thinking and self-awareness. |
| **Writing Quality & Clarity** | 5 | Writing is well-organized, clear, and mostly free of grammatical or spelling errors. Uses professional and respectful language throughout. |
