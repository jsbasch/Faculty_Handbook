**Points:** {{< var assign_points >}}

## Guidelines

[**Track your sleep**]{.underline}

You can use the following [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VgITm0K6Qw6Le1LUfEELAW6qA4j8q-VUhEkLPP0yJAM/edit?usp=sharing) to track your sleep, or you can create your own! The one that I made for class is based on the [National Sleep Foundation Sleep Diary](https://www.thensf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NSF-Sleep-Diary-Rev-2-2021.pdf).

Track your sleep for four consecutive days being sure to include the following information:

[Each Morning:]{.underline}

-   Date
-   Time you went to bed
-   How challenging it was to fall asleep
-   Number and time of awakenings
-   What time you got out of bed
-   How rested you felt (1-10 scale)
-   Any other notes about your night of sleep

[**Write a Reflection (200â€“300 words):**]{.underline}

-   Summarize your sleep patterns across the four days
-   Discuss how your sleep quantity and quality relate to concepts covered in the States of Consciousness module (e.g., stages of sleep, sleep deprivation, sleep hygiene)
-   Reflect on any changes you might make to improve your sleep
