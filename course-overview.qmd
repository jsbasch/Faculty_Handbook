This is the homepage for PSYC101 - Introduction to Psychology taught by Dr. Dustin Haraden in Summer 2025 at Rochester Institute of Technology. All course materials will be posted on this site.

You can find the course syllabus [here](/course-syllabus) and the course schedule [here](/index).

## Class Structure

This course will be accelerated, but will also be self-paced (i.e., asynchronous). There will be set deadlines for various projects/assignments, but you are free to structure your time otherwise. There will be 6 total units that cover a brief introduction into various areas of psychology. Each topic will typically consist of:

-   Brief Lectures
-   Readings
-   Assignment
-   Content Quiz

There will not be a final exam, but there will be a final project that will be due at the end of the semester.
