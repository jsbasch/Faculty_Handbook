I will ask each student to create a brief video introducing themselves (rubric will be posted). These will only be seen by the instructor. This introduction is a requirement by RIT for online courses as we need to confirm you are who you say you are (but I also want to get to know my students).\nDuring the first unit, you will also need to complete a brief quiz on the syllabus. You will be allowed to take the quiz as many times as you need to in order to receive the full credit. I want you to be aware of the policies in the course.\n\n\n\nTo help solidify the material and identify areas that you can focus your study, there will be regular quizzes consisting of multiple choice and short answer questions. These will be posted to myCourses and can be taken at any point prior to the deadline. All quizzes will become available at the beginning of the semester. There will be 25 multiple choice questions that will be taken mainly from the readings. Each quiz time limit will be 30 minutes. The quizzes will only cover the information from that specific topic (i.e., non-cumulative). Quizzes will be open-note. Lowest quiz grade will automatically be dropped.\n\n\n\nThe assignments for this class will consist of utilizing your knowledge of the topic and applying it to various examples in the real world. Each assignment will be related to a topic in the course, but will also allow you to incorporate information across multiple topics. The assignments will have different structures with some consisting inf written responses and others to incorporate other creative components. The goal of the assignments is to move beyond the textbook and classroom to investigate the application of psychology and to think like a psychologist.\n\n\n\nTo help bring the discussion beyond the class, there will be the expectation that you will create and engage with discussion posts (Minimum of 1 created & 1 response). The posts will focus on an area of psychology that is of interest to you. The goal of these posts is for you to share information that you have gathered from elsewhere and bring in to provide some additional information. Topics of these discussions may vary from examining the science behind pop-science articles, reflecting on reading a scientific study, identifying a popular myth in psychology and describing why it is a myth. More information will be available on myCourses/course site to highlight the specific content and expectations.\nDiscussion posts and replies must be completed prior to deadline (7/25/25 at 11:59pm)\n\n\n\nThe course will culminate in a final project that will be completed individually. You have the ability to choose the type of project you would like to complete. I want this to be a time for you to bring in any other creative elements that you would like. If you have other ideas for a type of project, please let me know. I am happy to update to accommodate your ideas if they continue to fit the expectations of the project. More information will be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful info\nSONA Director: Dr.¬†Dustin Haraden\nEmail: sona@rit.edu\nInformation website (for more guidance): https://ritpsych.github.io/sona/\nSona website (for signing up for studies): https://rit.sona-systems.com\n\n\n\nEvery PSYC101 student must earn 8 Sona credits. You earn 1 credit per 15 minutes of participation, plus a bonus credit for face-to-face studies, so this will take you a maximum of 2 hours to complete. To earn Sona credits, you must sign up for studies through the psychology department‚Äôs Sona website. Other research will not qualify.\n\nYour participation must be complete by 5pm on the last day of classes (i.e., the day before Reading Day). At that time, if you have NOT earned at least 8 credits, your final grade will be dropped by one ‚Äústep‚Äù ‚Äì that is, from A to A-, from B- to C+, or from D to F.

If you would like to request academic adjustments such as testing modifications due to a disability, please contact the Disability Services Office. Contact information for the DSO and information about how to request adjustments can be found at www.rit.edu/dso. After you receive academic adjustment approval, it is imperative that you contact me as early as possible so that we can work out whatever arrangement is necessary.\n\n\n\nAs an instructor, I¬†have a mandatory reporting responsibility¬†as a part of¬†my role. It is my goal that you feel comfortable sharing information related to your life experiences in classroom discussions, in your written work, and in our one-on-one meetings. I will seek to keep the information you share private to the greatest extent possible. However, I am required to¬†report information I¬†receive¬†regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred during your time at RIT.¬†\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to providing a safe learning environment, free of harassment and discrimination as articulated in our university policies located on our governance website. RIT‚Äôs policies require faculty to share information about incidents of gender-based discrimination and harassment with RIT‚Äôs Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators when incidents are stated to them directly. The information you provide to a non-confidential resource which includes faculty will be relayed only as necessary for the Title IX Coordinator to investigate and/or seek resolution. Even RIT Offices and employees who cannot guarantee confidentiality will maintain your privacy to the greatest extent possible.\nIf an individual discloses information during a public awareness event, a protest, during a class project, or advocacy event, RIT is not obligated to investigate based on this public disclosure. RIT may however use this information to further educate faculty, staff and students about prevention efforts and available resources.\nIf you would like to report an incident of gender based discrimination or harassment directly you may do so by using the online Sexual Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Reporting or anonymously by using the Compliance and Ethics Hotline. If you have a concern related to gender-based discrimination and/or harassment and prefer to have a confidential discussion, assistance is available from any of RIT‚Äôs confidential resources (listed below).\n\nRIT Counseling and Psychological Services\n\n585-475-2261 (V)\n585-475-6897 (TTY)\nwww.rit.edu/counseling\n\nNTID Counseling and Academic Advising\n\n585-475-6400\nwww.ntid.rit.edu/counselingdept\n\nRIT Student Health Center\n\n585-475-2255 (V)\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/studenthealth\n\nCenter for Religious Life\n\n585-475-2137\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/religion\n\nRIT Ombuds Office\n\n585-475-7357\n585-475-6424\n585-286-4677 (VP)\nwww.rit.edu/ombuds/contact-us\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an institution of higher learning, RIT expects students to behave honestly and ethically at all times, especially when submitting work for evaluation in conjunction with any course or degree requirement. The Department of Psychology encourages all students to become familiar with the RIT Honor Code and with RIT‚Äôs Academic Integrity Policy. RIT‚Äôs policy on academic integrity requires the instructor to investigate of any suspected breach of academic integrity. If the preponderance of evidence indicates a breach of academic integrity, the student who did so may incur a consequence up to and including failure for the entire course.\nAbout Generative AI\nEach course that you are involved in will have differing opinions and goals regarding generative AI (i.e., ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, etc.). In this course you are allowed to use these as a tool. You can use prompts such as ‚ÄúTeach me about (insert psych topic here) and give me an example that might apply to me.‚Äù If you do use generative AI, I would like for you to disclose that information just so I can have a sense of how it is being used. If I suspect that the work that you have turned in is using AI, we will have to have a conversation to determine the next steps. Turning in AI work is considered plagiarism, and you may be asked to re-do the assignment, or possibly receive a 0 on the assignment.\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to the safety of the RIT community and beyond.

    "text": "Description\nHave you ever trained a pet‚Ä¶ or yourself? Conditioning is all around us! Think about times when you get hungry after you hear the microwave beep, or avoid something because you are afraid of it.\nIn this assignment, you‚Äôll explore conditioning in a hands-on way and see psychological principles in your daily routine.\nPoints: 35\n\nInstructions\nPick Your Approach:\n\nüé∂ Classical Conditioning Example: Pair a neutral stimulus with something meaningful. For instance, play a specific song before your coffee each morning and see if your mood or alertness changes when you hear the song later.\nüç´ Operant Conditioning Example: Set up a reward system. For example, give yourself a piece of chocolate or a five-minute TikTok break each time you finish a section of reading to see if it increases your study motivation.\n\nDesign Your Mini Experiment:\n\nDecide what behavior or reaction you want to observe or change.\nChoose your stimulus or reward/punishment.\nCarry it out for 2‚Äì3 days to gather some observations.\n\nWrite a Reflection (350-450 words):\n\nBriefly describe your experiment setup and what you wanted to see happen\nIdentify the psychological principle(s) you used (classical or operant conditioning) and define them\nShare your results and whether your plan worked. Did you start craving coffee just from the song? Did rewards boost your motivation?\nReflect on how this connects to Learning, Memory, or Cognition concepts. Any challenges, surprises or new insights?\n\nNote: You will submit at least one document that has the above information. You will be graded on the reflection so be sure to explain the experiment thoroughly (enough for it to be replicated), and provide thoughtful comments/reflections.\n\n\nFriendly Reminders\nKeep it ethical and safe: no aversive stimuli or experimenting on others without their consent. Self-experiments or harmless conditioning are perfect here.\n\nThink creatively: Music, scents, colors, apps, or food rewards can all be powerful in conditioning.",

Some are built upon decades of research while others are less consistent and valid. You will compare 2 types of tests to one another.\nPoints: 35\n\nInstructions\nComplete Two Assessments:\n\nFirst Assessment (Research background):\n\n-   Take a **Big Five Personality Test** (e.g., Open Psychometrics Big Five).\n\nSecond Assessment (Less Validated):\n\nChoose a less scientifically supported test such as:\n\nMyers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) (free version online)\nEnneagram Test (free version online)\nAnother instructor-approved personality test lacking strong empirical support (send me an email with one you would like to use)\n\n\n\nRecord Your Results:\n\nNote your Big Five scores (e.g., high in openness, low in neuroticism).\nNote your MBTI type, Enneagram number, or equivalent classification.\n\nWrite a Reflection (350‚Äì450 words):\n\nDescribe both assessments (what they measure, how they classify people).\nSummarize your results from each.\nCompare and contrast the two assessments:\n\nHow do their approaches differ?\nWhich felt more accurate to you, and why?\nWhat are strengths and weaknesses of each based on course concepts and readings?\nReflect on what this comparison teaches you about personality psychology and assessment validity.\n\n\n\n\nRubric (35 points total)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria\nPoints\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAssessment Descriptions & Results\n10\nClearly describes both assessments, including what each measures, how it classifies people, and accurately summarizes personal results for both tests.
